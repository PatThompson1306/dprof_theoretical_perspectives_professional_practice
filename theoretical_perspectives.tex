%--------C.1 Introduction--------
\chapter{Introduction}  
\label{ch:introduction}

\section{Research context}
\label{sec:research-context}
This paper defines the research context before selecting the most appropriate methodology and strategy for the literature review which follows. 

Empirical observations, supported by academic and grey literature, \citep{finkelhor2024prevalence,CPAI2025} identify that reported instances of \gls{csa} are increasing, with resultant demand on policing outstripping proactive preventative capabilities.

The gap between demand and capability in both \gls{csa} and other operational areas of policing is acknowledged across the sector, generating political and organisational appetite for technological solutions, \citep{npcc2026policeai}.  Despite this appetite, evidence from both professional and academic sources identifes that policing is structurally complex and requires reform to better adopt technology, \citep{homeoffice2024reform}, with cultural barriers further diminishing the successful use of technological solutions, \citep{thompson2021missed,kassem2025their}.

These challenges are significant, yet they do not negate the potential of emerging technologies to address the identified capability gap.  Advances in \gls{nlp} technologies present an opportunity to deliver preventative safeguarding in the \gls{csa} context, acknowledging that the gap between technical possibility and operational deployment is not primarily technical but organisational.  

This paper explores how to bridge this gap, drawing on four literature tracks outlined  in section \ref{sec:purpose-and-scope-of-the-paper} in order to consider the proposed research challenge: \textit{How can natural language processing methods be developed and operationalised to identify precursors of contact sex offending against children, to enhance proactive safeguarding opportunities within the existing operational constraints of policing?}

This challenge consists of four thematic research areas: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What linguistic precursors of contact sex offending exist in offender-victim conversations?
  \item Which \gls{nlp} methods can be most effectively realised within policing infrastructure?
  \item What implementation barriers exist within policing that may hinder NLP adoption?
  \item What strategies can be developed to overcome those barriers?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Purpose and scope of the paper}  
\label{sec:purpose-and-scope-of-the-paper}
This research is inherently interdisciplinary, positioned at the intersection of technical and organisational domains. Accordingly, a literature review will require a multi-track approach, with each track addressing a different aspect of the research challenge. The four tracks are as follows: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first track explores the landscape of \gls{csa} and the linguistic characteristics which precede contact offending, establishing the empirical foundation for a technical solution.
    \item The second track reviews the technical literature on \gls{nlp} applications in safeguarding and criminal justice contexts, focusing on grooming language detection and the computational methods available for identifying linguistic precursors of contact offending.
    \item The third track examines the organisational dynamics of technology adoption in policing, drawing on both academic literature and empirical evidence of structural and cultural barriers to technical innovation.
    \item The fourth track addresses the ethical and governance boundaries within which any \gls{nlp} solution must operate, encompassing algorithmic bias, data protection, proportionality, and the ethical context surrounding preventative safeguarding.
\end{enumerate}

Each track is explored in depth, and their insights are then synthesised to identify where technical possibilities meet organisational realities. This structure enables a comprehensive understanding of both the capabilities and constraints shaping both the research problem and the practice improvement opportunity.
